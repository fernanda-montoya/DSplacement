## Question 1
This code webscrapes a wikipedia article on natural disasters and their death toll and then plots data relating to the death toll for a natural disaster throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

The resulting plot is contained in the pdf file "Death Toll Plot" where we note the death toll across time and the color of the points corresponds to the natural disaster type. The key for the disaster type is located to the right of the plot.
